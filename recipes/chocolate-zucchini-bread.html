    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>
        "Zucchini, like all squash, has its ancestry in the Americas, 
        specifically Mesoamerica. However, the varieties of green, 
        cylindrical squash harvested immature and typically called 
        "zucchini" were cultivated in northern Italy, as much as three 
        centuries after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas. 
        It appears that this occurred in the second half of the 19th 
        century, although the first description of the variety under 
        the name zucchini occurs in a work published in Milan in 1901.[9] 
        Early varieties usually appended the names of nearby cities in 
        their names.

    <p>
        The first records of zucchini in the United States date to 
        the early 1920s. It was almost certainly taken to America 
        by Italian immigrants and probably was first cultivated in 
        the United States in California. A 1928 report on vegetables 
        grown in New York State treats 'Zucchini' as one among 60 
        cultivated varieties of C. pepo.[16]" (Wikipedia)
