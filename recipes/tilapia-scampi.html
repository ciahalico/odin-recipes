    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>8 halved garlic cloves</li>
        <li>4, 6 ounce tilapia fillets, rinsed and patted dry</li>
        <li>1 tbs dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to  375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease a baking dish
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the lemon juice, butter, and garlic into a bowl and microwave
            in 10 second increments until butter and garlic is softened. This should take
            about 1 minute total.

        <li>
            Lay the tilapia fillets down on the baking dish and pour the mixture you
            made over the fillets, making sure they are covered completely and evenly.
            Sprinkle parsley as desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes total, flipping the fillets
            every 10 minutes, until the fish flakes.
