    <p>
        "The first written record of pasta comes from the Talmud in the 5th century AD 
        and refers to dried pasta that could be cooked through boiling,[3] 
        which was conveniently portable.[4] Some historians think that Arabs 
        introduced pasta to Europe during a conquest of Sicily. In the West, it may 
        have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century, 
        as the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi attested, reporting some traditions 
        about the Sicilian kingdom.[5]

        The popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment 
        of spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of 
        spaghetti for the Italian market.[6]

    <p>
        In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered
        in restaurants as Spaghetti Italienne (which likely consisted of noodles
        cooked past al dente, and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found 
        spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not 
        until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or 
        basil.[7][8][9]" (Wikipedia)
