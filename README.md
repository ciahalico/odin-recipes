# odin-recipes
Hello! This is my first website that I've created with The Odin Project. I wanted to practice my skills and also learn about some of the technology that web developers are involved in on a day-to-day basis. 

This is a recipe website with three recipes as of right now and very rough styling and template, but I'm super proud of it nonetheless! I learned alot about HTML, especially with links and images (like how to change the size of the image) I tried to make it look as neat as I could with my current knowledge. 

As for my experience using Git, it was mostly very smooth and fast using it throughout the project, but towards the end when I was 'finished' and wanted to deploy it, I ran into some issues with part of my branch becoming 'remote' and thus, my files weren't deploying the way that they were on my local environment. Using the 'pull' function, I was able to merge the branches and fix the deployment. 

I look forward to coming back to this project to improve and style it with my new skills as they are built, to hopefully make a project that is representative of all that I'm capable of.
